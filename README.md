# Web3 Task Platform

## Overview
This Web3-based platform enables users to post tasks and complete tasks in exchange for blockchain-based payments. The primary use case focuses on **YouTube thumbnail selection tasks**, where users upload multiple variants of a thumbnail, and workers vote on the best-performing option to optimize **Click-Through Rates (CTR)**.

The platform is **completely decentralized**, leveraging the **Solana blockchain** for payments and authentication. Users sign in via their wallets, eliminating the need for Web2-based authentication.
